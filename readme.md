# Arduino MKR1000/1010 with Azure IoT Central

## About

Arduino MKR1000 or MKR1010 code sample to send temperature and humidity data to Azure IoT Central.

## Features

* Works with both the Arduino MKR1000 or MKR1010 devices
* Uses a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity (no sensor no-problem, temperature and humidity data can be simulated)
* Uses simple MQTT to communicate to Azure IoT Central
* Simple code base designed to illustrate how the code works and encourage hacking
